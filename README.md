# ✩₊˚.⋆☾⋆⁺₊✧ Hello, My name is Lemon! ✩₊˚.⋆☾⋆⁺₊✧

#

- ✩₊˚.⋆☾⋆⁺₊✧ I'm an artist who is currently really into Sonic the Hedgehog but I'm always willing to talk about my other interests like Doctor Who, FNAF, Undertale and more! ✩₊˚.⋆☾⋆⁺₊✧

- ✩₊˚.⋆☾⋆⁺₊✧ When I do post, my art will likely only be posted on Bluesky. I don't post on most other sites anymore, just use them to look at other people's art. ✩₊˚.⋆☾⋆⁺₊✧

- ✩₊˚.⋆☾⋆⁺₊✧ My Discord is LemonAddi but I would prefer you ask first before sending me requests. My minimum requirement is literally just talking for a bit lmao. ✩₊˚.⋆☾⋆⁺₊✧

- ✩₊˚.⋆☾⋆⁺₊✧ My favourite Sonic character is Shadow the Hedgehog! ✩₊˚.⋆☾⋆⁺₊✧

- ✩₊˚.⋆☾⋆⁺₊✧ I am a selfshipper/yumeshipper. If that bothers you, you're free to not interact lol. I'm chill with everyone, even people who ship with my F/Os! ✩₊˚.⋆☾⋆⁺₊✧

- ✩₊˚.⋆☾⋆⁺₊✧ Main F/Os currently are Sonic and Shadow, on Ponytown you may see me sat as my Sona Ink. If I ever mention 'Sonadink' and you're wondering what I mean, it's just 'Sonadow' + 'Ink'. <3 ✩₊˚.⋆☾⋆⁺₊✧

- ✩₊˚.⋆☾⋆⁺₊✧ I am Autistic, have ADHD, Alexithymia and ARFID (All Diagnosed) and am like 99% sure I have Anxiety because there's so many signs but that one isn't diagnosed lmao. ✩₊˚.⋆☾⋆⁺₊✧

- ✩₊˚.⋆☾⋆⁺₊✧ I am Aromantic (Specifically ficto/cupio), DemiBisexual, Agender and use Neopronouns. ✩₊˚.⋆☾⋆⁺₊✧

- ✩₊˚.⋆☾⋆⁺₊✧ For those who don't know what Alexithymia is (Since I've been asked a lot), Alexithymia, also known as emotional blindness, is a psychological condition characterized by difficulties in recognizing, understanding, and expressing emotions. It's co-morbid with Autism and basically, sometimes I might not 'feel' a certain way but my body may react as if I am. It doesnt mean I don't care though, because while I may not always cry when 'appropriate' for example, I can find something sad. I just have difficulties truly expressing the way I feel. <3 ✩₊˚.⋆☾⋆⁺₊✧
